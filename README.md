## Summary
We learned quite a bit from the data set we were given. Our prime demographic will be men as they a much more likely to use the bikes. We also found that users are very likely to become subscribers. To dive a bit deeper we should investigate the length of time that subscribers keep their memberships. In addition we should investigate the ages of the users to more accurately gauge exactly what type of people are riding the bikes.
